## Overview

### Problem

1. Exports are limited up to a maximum of 40,000 messages
2. Exports skip the text portion of media-messages by replacing the entire message with `<Media omitted>` instead of for example `<Media omitted> My favorite selfie of us üòªüê∂ü§≥`
3. Exports are limited to a `.txt` file format

### Solution

_WhatSoup_ solves these problems by loading the entire chat history in a browser, scraping the chat messages (only text, no media), and exporting it to `.txt`, `.csv`, or `.html` file formats.

**Example output**:

_WhatsApp Chat with Bob Ross.txt_

```
02/14/2021, 02:04 PM - Eddy Harrington: Hey Bob üëã Let's move to Signal!
02/14/2021, 02:05 PM - Bob Ross: You can do anything you want. This is your world.
02/15/2021, 08:30 AM - Eddy Harrington: How about we use WhatSoup üç≤ to backup our cherished chats?
02/15/2021, 08:30 AM - Bob Ross: However you think it should be, that‚Äôs exactly how it should be.
02/15/2021, 08:31 AM - Eddy Harrington: You're the best, Bob ‚ù§
02/19/2021, 11:24 AM - Bob Ross: <Media omitted> My latest happy üå≤ painting for you.

## Demo

[![Watch the video on YouTube](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eddyharrington/WhatSoup/master/docs/demo.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3lNYk8pPeQ)

## Prerequisites

- You have a WhatsApp account
- You have Chrome browser installed
- You have some familiarity with setting up and running Python scripts
- Your terminal supports unicode (UTF-8) characters (for chat emoji's)

## Instructions

1. Make sure your WhatsApp chat settings are set to English language. This needs to be done on your phone (instructions [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/how-to-change-whatsapps-language/)). You can change it back afterwards, but for now the script relies on certain HTML elements/attributes that contain English characters/words.

2. Clone the repo:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/eddyharrington/WhatSoup.git
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

   ```
   # Windows
   python -m venv env

   # Linux & Mac
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```
   # Windows
   env/Scripts/activate

   # Linux & Mac
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   # Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Linux & Mac
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Setup your environment

- Download [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and extract it to a local folder (such as the `env` folder)
- Get your Chrome browser `Profile Path` by opening Chrome and entering `chrome://version` into the URL bar
- Create an `.env` file with an entry for `DRIVER_PATH` and `CHROME_PROFILE` that specify the directory paths for your ChromeDriver and your Chrome Profile from above steps:

  ```
  # Windows
  DRIVER_PATH = 'C:\path-to-your-driver\chromedriver.exe'
  CHROME_PROFILE = 'C:\Users\your-username\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data'

  # Linux & Mac
  DRIVER_PATH = '/Users/your-username/path-to-your-driver/chromedriver'
  CHROME_PROFILE = '/Users/your-username/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default'
  ```

7. Run the script

   ```
   # Windows
   python whatsoup.py

   # Linux & Mac
   python3 whatsoup.py
   ```

   **Note for Mac users**: you may get blocked when trying to run the script the first time with a message about chromedriver not being from an identified developer. This is normal. Follow [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60362134) to grant chromedriver an exception, then re-run the script.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does it download pictures / media?
No. 

### How large of chats can I load/export?

The most demanding part of the process is loading the entire chat in the browser, in which performance heavily depends on how much memory your computer has and how well Chrome handles the large DOM load. For reference, my largest chat (~50k messages) uses about 10GB of RAM.

### How long does it take to load/export?

Depends on the chat size and how performant your computer is, however below is a ballpark range to expect. For large chats, I recommend turning your PC's sleep/power settings to OFF and running the script in the evening or before bed so it loads over night.

| # of msgs in chat history   | Load time |
| :---       | :---     |
| 500        | 1 min    |
| 5,000      | 12 min   |
| 10,000     | 35 min   |
| 25,000     | 3.5 hrs  |
| 50,000     | 8 hrs    |

### Why is it so slow?!

Basically, browsers become easily bottlenecked when loading massive amounts of rich data in WhatsApp, which is a WebSocket application and is constantly sending/receiving information and changing the HTML/DOM.

I'm open to ideas but most of the things I tried didn't help performance:
- Chrome vs Firefox ‚ùå
- Headless browsing ‚ùå
- Disabling images ‚ùå
- Removing elements from DOM ‚ùå
- Changing 'experimental' browser settings to allocate more memory ‚ùå

### Can I...
1) **Use Firefox instead of Chrome?** Yes, not out of the box though. There are a few Selenium differences and nuances to get it working, which I can share if there's interest. TODO.
2) **Use headless?** Yes, but I only got this to work with Firefox and not Chrome.
3) **Use WhatSoup to scrape a local WhatsApp HTML file?** Yes, you'd just need to bypass a few functions from `main()` and load the HTML file into Selenium's driver, then run the scraping/exporting functions like the below. If there's enough interest I can look into adding this to WhatSoup myself. TODO.

    ```
    # Load and scrape data from local HTML file
    def local_scrape(driver):
        driver.get('C:\your-WhatSoup-dir\source.html')
        scraped = scrape_chat(driver)
        scrape_is_exported("source", scraped)
    ```
4) **Contribute to WhatSoup?** Please do!
